      <h2>2. Technical Description</h2>

      <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
      <p>
        The splash screen serves as the introductory point of the website, offering a brief but powerful overview of the
        site's mission through animated text and clean layout. I designed this page to auto-redirect users to the
        homepage after a few seconds using the <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh"&gt;</code> tag. To visually engage
        the user, I implemented animated loading effects and a mission title using CSS keyframe animations and
        transitions. The layout is centered both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox, with responsiveness built in
        through media queries to maintain structure across device sizes. The splash screen includes the project name,
        key messages, and team members, ensuring clarity while keeping the user experience smooth and professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond aesthetics, the splash screen plays a key role in setting the visual tone and professionalism of the
        entire site. I ensured the color scheme aligned with the Zero Hunger theme warm colors to invoke care and
        urgency. The loading animation provides visual feedback while users wait, which improves perceived performance.
        All text and graphical elements are aligned using Flexbox containers, making the layout stable on any screen
        size. I also structured the HTML using minimal nesting for better readability and future updates.
      </p>

      <h3>Food Waste in Sri Lanka</h3>
      <p>
        This content-heavy page provides educational insights into the issue of food waste specific to Sri Lanka. It is
        divided into structured sections including an Introduction, Situation Overview, Impact, and Proposed Solutions.
        I used semantic HTML5 elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> to clearly separate content while enhancing accessibility. To improve layout and
        responsiveness, I applied CSS Flexbox to arrange multiple content cards evenly. Cards contain a combination of
        text, headings, icons, and background visuals to make the content visually digestible. I also ensured that the
        typography, contrast ratios, and spacing followed accessibility standards. Responsive units and media queries
        were added to optimize the page for different screen sizes, including tablets and mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance user engagement, I integrated visual elements like icons and infographics next to key statistics,
        making the data more accessible to a wide audience. I also implemented scroll spacing and padding using relative
        units to ensure comfortable readability. Images are optimized for web performance, and headings follow a logical
        structure (H2 → H3) to support screen readers and indexing. I separated styling into
        <code>content_ST1.css</code> to keep the global stylesheet clean and the page-specific layout more maintainable.
      </p>

      <h3>Volunteer Page</h3>
      <p>
        This page was developed to highlight ongoing volunteering opportunities and to collect user feedback. I created
        interactive cards using HTML and CSS, each presenting volunteering programs with titles, descriptions, and a
        'Join' button. CSS Flexbox ensures that the cards are displayed in a responsive, grid-like format. I added hover
        effects to buttons and cards for better interactivity and visual appeal. Below the cards, I implemented a custom
        feedback section including a star rating system, emoji-based reactions, and a comment text box. The feedback
        mechanism was designed with user-friendliness in mind users can visually rate experiences and leave comments
        easily. I styled form elements to match the website's theme, ensuring consistency. I also separated the CSS for
        this page into a dedicated file for modular styling and included ARIA labels and proper input associations to
        improve screen reader compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major focus was on user interaction and intuitive navigation. I used hover transitions and button animations
        to indicate clickability and guide user behavior. The feedback form was designed with clear labeling and spacing
        to prevent input errors and support accessibility tools. I also introduced media queries to make the card grid
        adapt from a multi-column layout to a single column on smaller screens. Additionally, form elements are styled
        consistently using variables defined in <code>Global.css</code> to support future theming.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Organization</h2>
      <p>
        I separated CSS into <code>Global.css</code> for shared layout and styling across the site, and page-specific
        files like <code>volunteer.css</code> or <code>content_ST1.css</code> for custom designs. All HTML structures
        use semantic and readable tags. The layout follows a clear hierarchy of headings, content, and navigation.

      <h2>5. Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        During development, one of the key challenges I faced was achieving a fully responsive layout that maintained
        visual consistency across all screen sizes. This required extensive testing on various devices and refining
        Flexbox-based layouts to ensure elements like cards, navigation bars, and text blocks did not overlap or
        distort. Another challenge was managing modularity between multiple CSS files. As the project grew, it became
        essential to keep shared styles in <code>Global.css</code> and assign page-specific customizations in separate
        stylesheets. I also encountered difficulties aligning form components and icons while maintaining accessibility
        and responsiveness. Through this process, I learned the importance of designing mobile-first, validating
        HTML/CSS frequently, and breaking complex designs into smaller, reusable components.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility was a key focus throughout the development process. All images are tagged with descriptive
        <code>alt</code> attributes to support screen readers, and all text uses clear font contrast ratios for
        legibility. I applied semantic HTML5 elements such as <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to enhance keyboard navigation and assistive technology interpretation. I ensured
        headings follow a logical hierarchical order (H1 to H3), and forms use properly associated
        <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags for better usability. The layout supports keyboard-only navigation, and all
        interactive elements such as buttons and links include hover/focus styles for improved feedback. These efforts
        collectively enhance the website’s inclusivity and compliance with accessibility best practices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure the website complies with web standards and institutional requirements, I validated all HTML and CSS
        files through the W3C validator tools. Inline styling and scripting were avoided to maintain code separation and
        reusability. All content respects copyright regulations by avoiding plagiarism and ensuring proper attribution
        for external resources such as images and references. I also adhered to the Janet web publishing guidelines,
        which include clear navigation, semantic HTML5 structure, minimal use of JavaScript, and accessible content. No
        tracking or personal data collection mechanisms were used, respecting user privacy and ethical guidelines. Every
        file follows a consistent naming convention, making the project easier to maintain and audit.
