    <h1> Food Waste in Sri Lanka</h1>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Food waste has become a growing concern in Sri Lanka, where a significant portion of perfectly edible food is discarded every day. Despite rising food insecurity and economic challenges faced by many communities, large quantities of food are wasted across homes, markets, hotels, and restaurants. This issue not only contributes to environmental degradation through increased landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions, but also highlights a deeper imbalance in the country’s food distribution and consumption habits. Addressing food waste is essential for building a more sustainable, food-secure future for all Sri Lankans.</p>
      <p>While food waste is a global issue, its effects are especially pronounced in Sri Lanka due to the country's economic vulnerabilities and uneven food access. Studies show that more than half of municipal solid waste in Sri Lanka is composed of food scraps, much of it still edible. Urban centers like Colombo generate hundreds of tonnes of food waste daily, largely from restaurants, hotels, and markets. In rural areas, post-harvest losses from poor storage and transportation infrastructure also contribute heavily. These losses represent not just wasted food, but wasted effort, water, land, and energy. Reducing food waste is therefore critical not only for hunger reduction but also for environmental sustainability and national resource management.</p>

      <h2>2. Current Situation</h2>
      <p>Sri Lanka is currently facing a significant challenge when it comes to managing food waste. According to various studies, over 50% of the country’s municipal solid waste is made up of food scraps, much of which is still edible. In urban areas like Colombo, hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and households contribute hundreds of tonnes of food waste daily, often due to overproduction, improper storage, and lack of consumer awareness. Meanwhile, rural farming communities suffer from post-harvest losses due to poor infrastructure and inadequate cold storage. This widespread wastage occurs at a time when nearly one in four Sri Lankans experiences food insecurity, highlighting a critical imbalance between food availability and access. The current situation calls for urgent action to improve food handling, raise public awareness, and implement effective waste-reduction strategies.</p>

      <p>This pressing issue of food waste highlights a critical imbalance in Sri Lanka’s food system while large amounts of edible food are discarded daily, many people still face hunger and food insecurity. Addressing this challenge requires immediate and collective action from government bodies, businesses, and communities to improve food management practices, reduce waste, and promote equitable food distribution. Only through such coordinated efforts can Sri Lanka move toward a more sustainable and food-secure future for all its citizens.</p>

      <h2>3. Impact</h2>
      <p>Food waste in Sri Lanka has a direct and damaging impact on the nation’s poor and vulnerable communities. While tons of edible food are discarded daily by restaurants, markets, and households, many families across the country struggle to afford even one proper meal. This disconnect between waste and need worsens food insecurity, deepens poverty, and increases dependence on limited social support systems. For low-income groups, the rising cost of living and inflation make access to nutritious food even more difficult. Reducing food waste could help bridge this gap by redirecting surplus food to those in need, easing hunger, and creating a more just and equitable food system.</p>
      <p>Hunger and malnutrition in Sri Lanka show significant variation across different regions, with estate and coastal areas facing the most severe challenges. In districts like Nuwara Eliya and Badulla, malnutrition rates are alarmingly high 51% and 39% respectively largely due to poverty, limited infrastructure, and poor access to nutritious food. These estate regions also lack overall food security, putting vulnerable communities, especially children and women, at greater health risk. Coastal areas like Trincomalee and Jaffna also report high malnutrition, despite some access to food. Even in urban centers such as Colombo and Gampaha, where food is more available, malnutrition still affects a notable portion of the population, suggesting that affordability and diet quality remain concerns. This regional imbalance highlights the urgent need for targeted nutrition programs, better distribution systems, and sustainable food policies to ensure that all Sri Lankans have equal access to healthy, adequate food.</p>

      <h2>4. Solutions</h2>
      <p>Reducing food waste in Sri Lanka requires a multi-faceted approach that combines individual responsibility, community action, and policy-level support. One effective solution is composting organic waste, which turns food scraps into valuable fertilizer for agriculture instead of sending them to landfills. Additionally, food donation programs can play a major role by redirecting surplus food from restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets to those in need. These initiatives not only reduce waste but also help address hunger and malnutrition in vulnerable communities</p>
      <p>Becoming a volunteer in food waste reduction efforts is a meaningful way to contribute toward ending hunger and promoting sustainability in Sri Lanka. Volunteers can support food collection drives, help sort and distribute surplus meals, assist in community composting projects, or raise awareness through education campaigns. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a retiree, your time and effort can make a real difference in the lives of those struggling with food insecurity. By volunteering, you not only help reduce waste but also become part of a nationwide movement toward a fairer and more responsible food system.</p>
