      </div>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p class="content-para">Food waste has become a growing concern in Sri Lanka, where a significant portion of
        perfectly edible food is discarded every day. Despite rising food insecurity and economic challenges faced by
        many communities, large quantities of food are wasted across homes, markets, hotels, and restaurants. This issue
        not only contributes to environmental degradation through increased landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions,
        but also highlights a deeper imbalance in the country’s food distribution and consumption habits. Addressing
        food waste is essential for building a more sustainable, food-secure future for all Sri Lankans.</p>
      <p class="content-para">While food waste is a global issue, its effects are especially pronounced in Sri Lanka due
        to the country's economic vulnerabilities and uneven food access. Studies show that more than half of municipal
        solid waste in Sri Lanka is composed of food scraps, much of it still edible. Urban centers like Colombo
        generate hundreds of tonnes of food waste daily, largely from restaurants, hotels, and markets. In rural areas,
        post-harvest losses from poor storage and transportation infrastructure also contribute heavily. These losses
        represent not just wasted food, but wasted effort, water, land, and energy. Reducing food waste is therefore
        critical not only for hunger reduction but also for environmental sustainability and national resource
        management.</p>

      <h2>2. Current Situation</h2>
      <p class="content-para">Sri Lanka is currently facing a significant challenge when it comes to managing food
        waste. According to various studies, over 50% of the country’s municipal solid waste is made up of food scraps,
        much of which is still edible. In urban areas like Colombo, hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and households
        contribute hundreds of tonnes of food waste daily, often due to overproduction, improper storage, and lack of
        consumer awareness. Meanwhile, rural farming communities suffer from post-harvest losses due to poor
        infrastructure and inadequate cold storage. This widespread wastage occurs at a time when nearly one in four Sri
        Lankans experiences food insecurity, highlighting a critical imbalance between food availability and access. The
        current situation calls for urgent action to improve food handling, raise public awareness, and implement
        effective waste-reduction strategies.</p>

      <h2>3. Impact</h2>
      <p class="content-para">Food waste in Sri Lanka has a direct and damaging impact on the nation’s poor and
        vulnerable communities. While tons of edible food are discarded daily by restaurants, markets, and households,
        many families across the country struggle to afford even one proper meal. This disconnect between waste and need
        worsens food insecurity, deepens poverty, and increases dependence on limited social support systems. For
        low-income groups, the rising cost of living and inflation make access to nutritious food even more difficult.
        Reducing food waste could help bridge this gap by redirecting surplus food to those in need, easing hunger, and
        creating a more just and equitable food system.</p>
      <p class="content-para">Hunger and malnutrition in Sri Lanka show significant variation across different regions,
        with estate and coastal areas facing the most severe challenges. In districts like Nuwara Eliya and Badulla,
        malnutrition rates are alarmingly high—51% and 39% respectively—largely due to poverty, limited infrastructure,
        and poor access to nutritious food. These estate regions also lack overall food security, putting vulnerable
        communities, especially children and women, at greater health risk. Coastal areas like Trincomalee and Jaffna
        also report high malnutrition, despite some access to food. Even in urban centers such as Colombo and Gampaha,
        where food is more available, malnutrition still affects a notable portion of the population, suggesting that
        affordability and diet quality remain concerns. This regional imbalance highlights the urgent need for targeted
        nutrition programs, better distribution systems, and sustainable food policies to ensure that all Sri Lankans
        have equal access to healthy, adequate food.</p>

      <h2>4. Solutions</h2>
      <p class="content-para">Reducing food waste in Sri Lanka requires a multi-faceted approach that combines
        individual responsibility, community action, and policy-level support. One effective solution is composting
        organic waste, which turns food scraps into valuable fertilizer for agriculture instead of sending them to
        landfills. Additionally, food donation programs can play a major role by redirecting surplus food from
        restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets to those in need. These initiatives not only reduce waste but also help
        address hunger and malnutrition in vulnerable communities.</p>
      <p class="content-para">Becoming a volunteer in food waste reduction efforts is a meaningful way to contribute
        toward ending hunger and promoting sustainability in Sri Lanka. Volunteers can support food collection drives,
        help sort and distribute surplus meals, assist in community composting projects, or raise awareness through
        education campaigns. Whether you're a student, a professional, or a retiree, your time and effort can make a
        real difference in the lives of those struggling with food insecurity. By volunteering, you not only help reduce
        waste but also become part of a nationwide movement toward a fairer and more responsible food system.</p>
